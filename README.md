# Inventory-Management-System_SQL

This project is a simple Inventory Management System developed using SQL. The system is designed to manage product inventory, track sales, and generate basic reports.

# Requirements
Database Schema
Created a database schema named InventoryDB with tables:

Products: Columns include ProductID, ProductName, CategoryID, UnitPrice, UnitsInStock.
Categories: Columns include CategoryID, CategoryName.
Sales: Columns include SaleID, ProductID, SaleDate, QuantitySold.
Data Population
Inserted sample data into the Products and Categories tables for testing purposes.

# Basic Operations
Implemented SQL queries for adding, updating, and deleting products. Recorded product sales using SQL queries.

# Data Integrity
Implemented data integrity constraints, including foreign key constraints between Products.CategoryID and Categories.CategoryID.

# Data Validation
Included basic data validation checks, such as ensuring unit price is positive and quantity sold is non-negative.

# Reports
Created SQL queries to generate basic reports, such as total sales by product or category and current inventory status.

# Documentation
Provided documentation explaining the database schema, table structures, and sample queries for basic operations and reports.

# Testing (Testing is still to be completed)
Thoroughly tested SQL queries to ensure they perform as expected and handle edge cases gracefully.

# GitHub Repository
Uploaded the project to GitHub, including SQL script files, documentation, and any additional resources.
